# Belly-Button-Challenge
------------
## Project Description
### GOAL: Visualize the data collected in a study about belly button wash frequency and the types and number of bacteria found in the various subject's belly buttons. This was my first experience, outside of in class learning, using the D3 library, using the "this" keyword, creating a dropdown, synthesizing and formatting a bubble chart, as well as a gauge chart.
